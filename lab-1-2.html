<h1>Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
<p>The following is a quote from www.poets.org:</p>

<blockquote>Edgar Allan Poe was born in
Boston, Massachusetts, on January 19, 1809. Poe’s father and
mother, both professional actors, died before the poet was
three and John and Frances Allan raised him as a foster
child in Richmond, Virginia.</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>John Allan, a prosperous
tobacco exporter, sent Poe to the best boarding schools and
later to the University of Virginia, where Poe excelled
academically. After less than one year of school, however,
he was forced to leave the University when Allan refused to
pay his gambling debts.</blockquote></blockquote>
